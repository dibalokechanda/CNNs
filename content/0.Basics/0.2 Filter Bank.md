>[!info] "Filter" and "Kernel" is used interchangeably in context of CNN.

In convolutional neural network, we use multiple filters. In the following diagram it is shown how $3$ filters is used to construct the output feature volume from a input feature volume.

In actual networks the number is far more than $3$. There is a term to refer to all the filters at once, which is "filter bank". Think of it as a collection of a set of filters. 


> The number of filters determine the channel depth for the output feature volume. 
> Number of filters = Depth of the output feature volume.


### Notation 

| Input Feature Volume                                        | Output Feature Volume                                                    |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| - *Height* : $H$<br>- *Width* : $W$<br>- $Depth$ : $C_{in}$ | - *Height* : $H_{out}$<br>- *Width* : $W_{out}$<br>- $Depth$ : $C_{out}$ |
