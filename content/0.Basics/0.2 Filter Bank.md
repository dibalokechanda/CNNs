>[!info] "Filter" and "Kernel" is used interchangeably in context of CNN.

In convolutional neural network, we use multiple filters. In the following diagram it is shown how $3$ filters is used to construct the output feature volume from a input feature volume.

In actual networks the number is far more than $3$. There is a term to refer to all the filters at once, which is "filter bank". Think of it as a collection of a set of filters. 


> The number of filters determine the channel depth for the output feature volume. 
> Number of filters = Depth of the output feature volume.


### Notation 

| Input Feature Volume                                        | Output Feature Volume                                                    | Filter Bank Shape                                                                              |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| - *Height* : $H$<br>- *Width* : $W$<br>- *Depth* : $C_{in}$ | - *Height* : $H_{out}$<br>- *Width* : $W_{out}$<br>- *Depth* : $C_{out}$ | - *Height* : $K$<br>- *Width*: $K$<br>- *Depth* : $C_{in}$<br>- *Number of Filter* : $C_{out}$ |

Based on these notation the following observations can be made:

- The height and width of all the filters in a filter bank is same. In other words, the spatial dimension of the filters are $K \times K$ which is square.
- The depth of the filters in a filter bank is equal to depth of the input feature volume which is $C_{in}$
- The number of filters in a filter bank determines the depth of the output feature volume.

The above diagram visualizes a filter bank where the number of filters is $C_{out}$. For this particular visualization $K=3$. 

> Note that, except for $K$ all the other parameters regarding the filter bank can be automatically determined. Meaning we know  $K=3$, we can safely assume the spatial dimension is $3 \times 3$. There is no need to explicitly specify the depth of the filters as it will always be equal to the depth of the input feature volume ( $C_{in}$ ). Similarly for the number of filters which is equal to the output feature volume ( $C_{out}$ ).
