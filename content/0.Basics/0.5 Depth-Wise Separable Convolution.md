The depth-wise separable convolution can be broken down in to three steps. 

## Step-1: Split Input Feature Volume Into Channels
The first step is splitting the input feature volume into separate 2D feature grids. See the diagram below which shows a feature volume with $C_{in}=6$ and in the first step it is separated into $6$ feature grids.

The following animation shows a visualization the splitting of channels take place.

## Step-2: Applying Separate Filters For Each Channels (Depth-wise Convolution)

The second step is applying a separate filter for each 2D feature grid which will result in output 2D feature 2D feature grid. Also the the filters used does not have a depth dimension.

The following animation shows the depth-wise convolution process:

You will notice that the filters weights only depend on the individual channels i.e. all the weights learned by filters are completely independent of each other. This is completley 

## Step-3: Apply Pointwise Convolution ($1 \times 1$ Convolution)
