The depth-wise separable convolution can be broken down in to three steps. 

## Step-1: Split Input Feature Volume Into Channels

> In practice, you actually do not need to split the channels.

The first step is splitting the input feature volume into separate 2D feature grids. See the diagram below which shows a feature volume with $C_{in}=6$ and in the first step it is separated into $6$ feature grids.

## Step-2: Applying Separate Filters For Each Channels (Depth-wise Convolution)

The second step is applying a separate filter for each 2D feature grid which will result in output 2D feature 2D feature grid. Also the the filters used does not have a depth dimension.

The following animation shows the depth-wise convolution process:

You will notice that the filters weights only depend on the individual channels i.e. all the weights learned by filters are completely independent of each other. This is different from the traditional convolution operation in CNN. 

In the next step this can fixed by applying a pointwise convolution

## Step-3: Apply Pointwise Convolution ($1 \times 1$ Convolution)

In the context of depth-wise separable convolution $1\times1$ convolution is always referred to as point-wise convolution.
