## Spatial Dimension 
The spatial dimension refers to the height and width dimensions in the feature volume. In the visualization above it is shown as the "blue" colored surface.

Couple of notes regarding this:

- The convolutional kernel is moved only along the spatial dimension in Conv2D.
- The spatial dimension of the feature volume changes as we move along the convolutional neural network. It depends on factors like stride, padding, kernel size, etc.
## Aggressive Stem 

This is a common strategy used in most CNN architectures. At the first couple of layers of the CNN using larger kernel size to down sample spatial resolution very rapidly. This allows for complex layer designs at the later stages with small computational complexity.

## Bottleneck

The bottleneck layer refers to the stage in the CNN where, the number of channel/features is reduced.
