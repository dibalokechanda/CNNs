## Spatial Dimension 
The spatial dimension refers to the height and width dimensions in the feature volume. In the visualization above it is shown as the "blue" colored surface.

Couple of notes regarding this:

- The convolutional kernel is moved only along the spatial dimension in Conv2D.
- The spatial dimension of the feature volume changes as we move along the convolutional neural network. It depends on factors like stride, padding, kernel size, etc.
## Aggressive Stem 

This is a common strategy used in most CNN architectures. At the first couple of layers of the CNN using larger kernel size to down sample spatial resolution very rapidly. This allows for complex layer designs at the later stages with small computational complexity.

## Bottleneck

The bottleneck layer refers to the stage in a CNN where, the number of channel/features is reduced. Consider the visualization below. From the Layer $(l-1)$ to Layer $l$ there is a decrease in number of channels and then in the next layer there is again an increase in number of channels.

The most typical way to create a bottleneck is utilizing $1\times1$ convolutions. As we know using $1\times1$ convolution does not change the spatial dimension; however depending on the number of filters used the depth dimension can be changed.
## Expansion Factor
Usually after bottleneck, there is an expansion stage where the number of channels is increased. The factor by which the number of channels increases is denoted as the "expansion factor".
As an example in ResNet-50, ResNet-101 and ResNet-152 there are several bottleneck and expansion stages. For all of them the expansion factor is $4$.

$$
\boxed{\frac{256}{64}=\frac{512}{128}=\frac{1024}{256} = \frac{2048}{512}=4}
$$
