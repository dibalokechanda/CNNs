$1\times 1$ convolution which is also referred to as point-wise convolution is a special type of convolution which does not change the spatial dimension of the feature map.

According to the visualization above, you will notice the input and output feature volume have the same spatial dimension meaning the height and width didn't change. 

$$
H_{in}=H_{out}
$$
$$
W_{in}= W_{out}
$$

But the channel dimension can change depending on the number of filters used. In practical implementations, this is one of the most useful use cases of $1\times 1$ which is changing the number of channels in the output feature volume.


> $1 \times 1$ convolution is referred as point-wise convolution in the context of depth-wise separable convolution.
