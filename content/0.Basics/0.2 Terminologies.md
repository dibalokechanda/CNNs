## Spatial Dimension 

![[Pasted image 20240626152050.png]]

The spatial dimension refers to the height and width dimensions in the feature volume. In the visualization above it is shown as the "blue" colored surface.

Couple of notes regarding this:

- The convolutional kernel is moved only along the spatial dimension in Conv2D.
- The spatial dimension of the feature volume changes as we move along the convolutional neural network. It depends on factors like stride, padding, kernel size, etc.
